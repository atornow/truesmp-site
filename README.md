<p align="center">A full-stack application built with PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.</p>

<h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>

<p>These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You will need the following tools installed on your system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Node.js and npm</li>
  <li>Docker and Docker Compose</li>
  <li>Git</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to get your development environment running:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository locally</li>
  <li>Navigate to the project folder</li>
  <li>Run <code>docker-compose up --build</code> to build and start the containers</li>
</ol>

<h2>📦 Services</h2>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<p>The backend service is a Node.js application using Express.js. It is responsible for API endpoints and includes a cron job to update user statistics.</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<p>The frontend service is a React application that communicates with the backend and provides a user interface for login, registration, and user profiles.</p>

<h3>Database</h3>

<p>The application uses PostgreSQL as its database service to store user data and mined statistics.</p>

<h2>🔧 Configuration</h2>

<p>The application is configured through a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file that sets up three services: backend, frontend, and db. Environment variables are used for sensitive data.</p>

<h2>🔐 Security</h2>

<p>User authentication is managed through JWT tokens and password hashing on the backend.</p>
